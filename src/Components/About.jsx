        Honestly, we have the freedom to shape this however we like. The professor
        mentioned that the content itself doesn&apos;t matter as muchâ€”we could even
        use placeholder text. What truly counts is demonstrating that we can
        build the functionality. So, stay tuned for what&apos;s next!
